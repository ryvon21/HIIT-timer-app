This was a self directed project for my last semester of college;  used to demonstrate my knowledge of different front-end technologies and more specifically, React. To demonstrate my ability to understand and use hooks, props and states.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in developing the actual application.
